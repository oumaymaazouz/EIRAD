                   <h3>CEO MESSAGE</h3>
                   <p>
                    “One of the underlying keys to our success has always been that we value the success of partners and customers above all, and the service quality and excellence has always been in the DNA of our structure. We genuinely believe that “giving back” should be one of the most important components of our business endeavor.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Although the Eirad Group has been in existence for more than a quarter of a century, with more than 1,000 employees that work in many of the individual business, subsidiaries, and entities, we still continue to operate as a startup, where we interact with each key members of our team on regular basis and never losing the “personal bond” that we have fostered over the years, and to never negate the fact that Eirad Group is just “one big family” at the end of the day.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    As I look ahead with the vision of 2030, I see us leading the way, in not only supporting the realization of “Vision of 2030” but playing an essential part in helping our partners and customers propelling beyond it.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    We will continue to stay as a financially viable company that exudes confidence, respect, and trust to our partners, employees, customers and community.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    As our company continues to achieve new heights and evolves its operations, it is vital that we must continue to promote a favorable and lasting impression of mutual growth.”
