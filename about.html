            <p>
              One of the underlying keys to our success has always been that we
              value the success of partners and customers above all, and the
              service quality and excellence has always been in the DNA of our
              structure. We genuinely believe that “giving back” should be one
              of the most important components of our business endeavor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the Eirad Group has been in existence for more than a
              quarter of a century, with more than 1,000 employees that work in
              many of the individual business, subsidiaries, and entities, we
              still continue to operate as a startup, where we interact with
              each key members of our team on regular basis and never losing the
              “personal bond” that we have fostered over the years, and to never
              negate the fact that Eirad Group is just “one big family” at the
              end of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I look ahead with the vision of 2030, I see us leading the way,
              in not only supporting the realization of “Vision of 2030” but
              playing an essential part in helping our partners and customers
              propelling beyond it.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will continue to stay as a financially viable company that
              exudes confidence, respect, and trust to our partners, employees,
              customers and community.
            </p>
            <p>
              As our company continues to achieve new heights and evolves its
              operations, it is vital that we must continue to promote a
              favorable and lasting impression of mutual growth.
