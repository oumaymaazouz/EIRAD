                <p>
                  One of the underlying keys to our success has always been that
                  we value the success of partners and customers above all, and
                  the service quality and excellence has always been in the DNA
                  of our structure. We genuinely believe that “giving back”
                  should be one of the most important component of our business
                  endeavor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although EIRAD Group has been in business for more than a
                  quarter of a century, with more than 1,000 employees that work
                  in many of the individual business, subsidiaries, and
                  entities, we still continue to operate as a startup, where we
                  interact with each key members of our team on regular basis
                  and never lose the “personal bond” that we have fostered over
                  the years, and to never negate the fact that EIRAD Group is
                  just “one big family” at the end of the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As I look ahead with the vision of 2030, I see us leading the
                  way, in not only supporting the realization of “Vision of
                  2030” but playing an essential part in helping our partners
                  and customers beyond it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will continue to stay as a financially viable company that
                  exudes confidence, respect, and trust to our partners,
                  employees, customers and community.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As our company continues to achieve new heights and evolves
                  its operations, it is vital that we must continue to promote a
                  favorable and lasting impression of mutual growth.
